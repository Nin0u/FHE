# FHE
This project implements Fully Homomorphic Encryption following Craig Gentry's papers (2009) using the variant of Smart and Vercauteren.

**WARNING** : It is known that encrypting a single bit takes a lot of time. We don't recommend to run computations on your laptop.

The project actually runs tests that prove that the encryption is fully homomorphic.
